A collection of mods for Rogue Fable III.

Each mod relies upon the Fabric Modcore Wrapper API. Install a mod by adding its file to the `rogue-fable-III` folder, and linking to it in the `index.html`, *after* `Fabric.js`


# Fabric.js
This is the Modcore Wrapper API that all the mods depend on. Add it to the folder, linking it in the index after all the vanilla files, but before any mods.
